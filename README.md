# code
repo of code and projects i have created
First thing- this is a joint effort between me writing and Chatgpt or Claude
troubleshooting with me.  AI also has done some of the scaffolding for me.

Don't go into the incomplete folder, lord knows what half written code is in there.

Feel free to use, comment, or steal any of this code, but be forewarned, make sure you know what it does before you use it.  

## USE AT YOUR OWN PERIL
